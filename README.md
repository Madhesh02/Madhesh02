# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Madhesh Anandan and I welcome you to my GitHub repository.
I am a passionate MSc Data Science and Computational Intelligence student on the track of becoming a certified Data Scientist in Coventry University.
(I know it's a bit cheesy ðŸ˜… but it is what it is)
I like working with data and also performing cool visualizations. Rather than being manipulative IRL, which dosen't give us anything (well that is my assumption because I don't really know what we'll get out of someone by being manipulative) I prefer to be a person that manipulates the data that I wrok on and provide meaningful insights and predictions.
Iâ€™m a massive gamer geek, motorcyclist and I'm interested in football, going to gym and skipping leg day, getting wasted with friends (sometimes) and oh working as a Data Scientist.  
I'm looking to work as a Data Scientist to showcase my talent and provide the organization with the success that they are looking for to my extent. I also believe in making an impact in the world of data however small it is.
