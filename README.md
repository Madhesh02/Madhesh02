# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Madhesh Anandan and I welcome you to my GitHub repository.
I am a Data Analyst and I completed my Master's degree in Data Science and Computational Intelligence Coventry University.
I like working with data and also performing cool visualizations. Rather than being manipulative IRL, I prefer to be a person that manipulates the data that I work on and provide meaningful insights and predictions.
Iâ€™m a massive gamer geek, motorcyclist and I'm interested in football(sort of), going to gym and skipping leg day, getting wasted with friends (sometimes) and oh working as a Data Analyst.  
I'm open to work as a Data Analyst to showcase my talent and provide the organization with the success that they are looking for to my extent. I also believe in making an impact in the world of data however small it is.
